#### Presentation
HRnet is an application that manages employee records. The application is old and uses jQuery on the front end, which leads to considerable bugs and increased internal complaints.
My mission as a front-end developer is to :

- Convert the whole HRNet project to ReactJs.
- Convert one of the four current jQuery plugins to ReactJs. (Publish the React component on npm as a package)
- Replace the 3 remaining jQuery plugins with React components
- Perform Lighthouse performance tests comparing the old and new application.

For this project, i created a npm package to display data in a dynamic table and it can be filtered and sorted.


#### Launching the project
